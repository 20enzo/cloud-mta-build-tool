# MTA services

The MTA service provides a convenient way for working on mta related topics such as development descriptor and deployment descriptor.

### Multi-Target Applications

A multi-Target application is a package comprised of multiple application and resource modules, 
which have been created using different technologies and deployed to different run-times; however, they have a common life-cycle. 
A user can bundle the modules together, describe (using the `mta.yaml` file) them along with their inter-dependencies to other modules, 
services, and interfaces, and package them in an MTA project.
