> <b>Disclaimer</b>: The multi-target application archive build tool is under heavy development and is currently in a `pre-alpha` stage.
                   Some functionality is still missing and the APIs are subject to change; use at your own risk.



## Description

The multi-target application archive builder is a standalone command-line tool that builds a deployment-ready
multi-target application (MTA) archive `.mtar` file from the artifacts of an MTA project according to the project’s MTA
development descriptor (`mta.yaml` file) or from module build artifacts according to the MTA deployment descriptor (`mtad.yaml` file).

### Multi-Target Application

Before using this package, be sure you are familiar with the multi-target application concept and terminology.
For background and detailed information, see the [Multi-Target Application Model](https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/06/e2f618e4-757c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html) guide.                   

## Usage

### Commands

| Command | Usage        | Description                                                    | Supported
| ------  | ------       |  ----------                                                    |  ----------
| version | `mbt -v`     | Prints the multi-target application archive builder version.                                        | x
| help    | `mbt -h`     | Prints all the available commands.                             | x
| assemble    | `mbt assemble`     | Creates an MTA archive `.mtar` file from the module build artifacts according to the MTA deployment descriptor (`mtad.yaml` file). Runs the command in the directory where the `mtad.yaml` file is located. **Note:** Make sure the path property of each module's `mtad.yaml` file points to the module's build artifacts you want to package into the target MTA archive. | x
| init    | `mbt init`     | Generates `Makefile.mta` according to the MTA descriptor (mta.yaml file or mtad.yaml file). <br> The `make` command will use the generated `Makefile.mta` to package the MTA project. | x

For more information, see the command help output available via `mbt [command] --help` or `mbt [command] -h`.

### Makefile
The generated by the `mbt init` command `Makefile.mta` file is the actual project "builder" which provides verbose build manifest that can be changed according to the project needs and responsible for:
- Building each of the modules in the MTA project.
- invoking the MBT commands in the right order
- Archive the MTA project
Use make command to package the MTA project using the following parameters:



| Description             | Parameter        | Arguments                                           | Examples    
| ------------------  | ------       |  ----------                                           |  ----------------
| Deployment platform – mandatory. | `p`      | Deployment platform: cf/neo/xsa.                                      |`make -f Makefile.mta p=cf`
| Target folder – optional.    | `t`     | Folder for generated MTAR. The default value is the current folder. If this parameter is not provided the MTAR file will be saved in the “mta_archives” subfolder of the current folder. If the parameter is provided, the MTAR file will be saved in the root of the folder provided by the argument.                              | `make -f Makefile.mta p=cf t=C:\temp`
| Archive name – optional.    | `mtar`     | File name for the generated MTAR. If this parameter is omitted file name is created according to the following pattern: <br> <mta_application_ID>_<mta_application_version>.mtar. <br> If parameter provided, but does not include extension, .mtar extension will be used. | `make -f Makefile.mta p=cf mtar=myMta<br><br> make -f Makefile.mta p=cf mtar=myMta.mtar`
| Duplicated fields and fields not defined in the "mta.yaml" schema handling – optional.    | `strict`     | Default value is “true”. If set to true, duplicated fields and fields not defined in the "mta.yaml" schema are reported as errors; if set to false, they are reported as warnings. | `make -f Makefile.mta p=cf strict=false`


#### Quick start example

```go

// Generate Makefile.mta file

mbt init 

// Execute MTA project build

make -f Makefile.mta p=cf

```
