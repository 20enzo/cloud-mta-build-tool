#### The Cloud MTA Build Tool overview
The Cloud MTA Build Tool is a standalone command-line tool that builds a deployment-ready
multi-target application (MTA) archive `.mtar` file from the artifacts of an MTA project according to the projectâ€™s MTA
development descriptor (`mta.yaml` file) or from module build artifacts according to the MTA deployment descriptor (`mtad.yaml` file). Also it provides commands for runing intermediate build process steps, for example, the mta.yaml file validations,building a single module according to configurations in the development descriptor, generating deployment descriptor, etc.
