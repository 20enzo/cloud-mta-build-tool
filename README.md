<b>Disclaimer</b>: The MTA build tool is under heavy development and is currently in a `pre-alpha` stage.
                   Some functionality is still missing and the APIs are subject to change; use at your own risk.
                   

# Prerequisite

You are familiar with the multi-target application concept and terminology. 
For background and detailed information, see The Multi-Target Application Model  guide.                   
                   

#Description

The multi-target application archive builder is a standalone command-line tool that builds a deployment-ready 
multi-target application (MTA) archive .mtar file from the artifacts of an MTA project according to the projectâ€™s MTA 
development descriptor (mta.yaml file) or from module build artifacts according to MTA deployment descriptor (mtad.yaml file)
                  
#Usage

## Commands

| Command | usage        | description                                                    | supported 
| ------  | ------       |  ----------                                                    |  ---------- 
| version | `mbt -v`     | Prints the MBT version.                                        | x
| help    | `mbt -h`     | Prints all the available commands.                             | x
| assemble    | `mbt assemble`     | Creates (MTA) archive .mtar file from module build artifacts according to MTA deployment descriptor (mtad.yaml file). Run the command in the directory where the mtad.yaml file is located. Make sure the path property of each modules in mtad.yaml points to the module build artifacts that should be packaged into the target mta archive. | x
| additional commands  | `tbd`              | `tbd`                                 |
